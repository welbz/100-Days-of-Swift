/*
 CALayer
 By default, the border of CALayer is black, but you can change that if you want by using the UIColor data type. I said that CALayer brings with it a little more complexity, and here's where it starts to be visible:
 
 CALayer sits at a lower technical level than UIButton, which means it doesn't understand what a UIColor is.
 UIButton knows what a UIColor is because they are both at the same technical level, but CALayer is below UIButton, so UIColor is a mystery.

 Don't despair, though: CALayer has its own way of setting colors called CGColor,
 - which comes from Apple's Core Graphics framework.
 - This, like CALayer, is at a lower level than UIButton, so the two can talk happily

 Even better, UIColor (which sits above CGColor) is able to convert to and from CGColor easily, which means you don't need to worry about the complexity
