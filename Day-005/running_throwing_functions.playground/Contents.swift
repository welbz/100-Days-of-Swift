// Running throwing functions

/*
 Swift doesn’t like errors to happen when your program runs, which means it won’t let you run an error-throwing function by accident.

 Instead, you need to call these functions using three new keywords: do starts a section of code that might cause problems, try is used before every function that might throw an error, and catch lets you handle errors gracefully.

 If any errors are thrown inside the do block, execution immediately jumps to the catch block. Let’s try calling checkPassword() with a parameter that throws an error:
 */

enum PasswordError: Error {
    case obvious
}


func checkPassword (_ password: String) throws -> Bool {
    if password == "password" {
        throw PasswordError.obvious
    }
    return true
}

/*

*/

do {
    try checkPassword("Welby")
    print("That password is good!")
} catch {
    print("You cant use that password.")
}

do {
    try checkPassword("password")
    print("That password is good!") // never reached
} catch {
    print("You cant use that password.")
}
// If any errors are thrown inside the do block, execution immediately jumps to the catch block
