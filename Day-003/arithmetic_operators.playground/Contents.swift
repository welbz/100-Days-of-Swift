// The remainder operator
// The remainder operator (a % b) works out how many multiples of b will fit inside a and returns the value that is left over (known as the remainder).
let remainer = 13 % secondScore

let remainer2 = 9 % 4
// Hereâ€™s how the remainder operator works. To calculate 9 % 4, you first work out how many 4s will fit inside 9:
