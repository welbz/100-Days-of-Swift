// Creating empty collections

/*
 Arrays, sets, and dictionaries are called collections, because they collect values together in one place.

Creating an empty collection needs opening and closing parentheses.
 */

// Empty Dictionary
var teams = [String: String]()
teams["Welby"] = "Blue"

// Empty Array
var results = [Int]()

// Empty Set - diff to others
// sets need angled brackets
var words = Set<String>()
var numbers = Set<String>()
