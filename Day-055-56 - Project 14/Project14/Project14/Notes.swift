/*
 SKAction.wait(forDuration:) creates an action that waits for a period of time, measured in seconds.
 
 SKAction.run(block:) will run any code we want, provided as a closure. "Block" is Objective-C's name for a Swift closure.
 
 SKAction.sequence() takes an array of actions, and executes them in order. Each action won't start executing until the previous one finished.
